<h3>Overview</h3>
This example provides the workflow how to build deep learning model using GUI applications in MATLAB. I was inspired from a MathWork's blog posted by Johanna Pingel (Link : Covid-19 Medical image Detection). It describes how to build detection and diagnosis tools of COVID-19 radiography image, it offers a valueble second opinion to the doctors and assit them in the screening process. This type of mechanism would also assist in providing results to the doctors quickly. <br>
In my example, we are fying through the GUI to build a deep learning (DL) model to detect COVID-19 on Chest Radiography using MATLAB.<br>

<h3>Dataset</h3>
1) COVID-19 Radiography Medical Image, I randomly extract 90 images from COVID-19 dataset curated by Dr. Joseph Cohen.<br>
2) Normal Chest Radiography Medical Image, I reandomly extract 90 images from Kaggle dataset posted by Paul Mooney.<br> 
<h3>Highlights </h3>
1) Understand the concept of AI and Transfer Learning<br>
2) Learn how to train Classificaion Model using Transfer Learning<br>
3) Learn how to build deep learning model using Deep Network Designer<br> 
4) Learn how to fine tune the deep learning model using Experiment Manager<br>
<h3>Product Focus</h3>
MATLAB (R2020a)<br>
Deep Learning Toolbox (R2020a)<br>
If you are using MATLAB version R2019a/R2019b, you may consider to use transfer learning app (Community App)
